🔍 Domain Reconnaissance Tool

Welcome to the Domain Reconnaissance Tool! This powerful Python script is designed to aid in the reconnaissance phase of cybersecurity assessments. It leverages various tools and techniques to gather information about a domain, including finding subdomains, conducting Nmap scans, identifying the technology stack, and searching for potential exploits.

🚀 Key Features:

- Subdomain Enumeration: Utilizes Sublist3r to discover subdomains associated with the target domain.
- Nmap Scanning: Performs fast Nmap scans to uncover open ports and services.
- Technology Stack Identification: Determines the technology stack used by the target domain using BuiltWith API.
- Exploit Searching: Searches for potential exploits relevant to the identified technologies using SearchSploit.

🛠️ Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script with the target domain as an argument: `python recon_tool.py (domain)`.
